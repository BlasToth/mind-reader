# Do you remember that "mind-reading" Flash game back in the 2000s?
It went "viral" and it was fun. Now, like 20 years later you can't even
open it and the official support for Flash finally ended on December 31st, 2020. RIP.

So I decided to build a remake, using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, allowing every netizen to have some fun without too much ado.

Here you are. The NO SWF Mind Reader

I also made it multilingual (languages: English, Spanish, Hungarian, Russian). 
 
This is a tribute to the original version.
